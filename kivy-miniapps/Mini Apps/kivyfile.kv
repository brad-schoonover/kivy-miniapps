#Welcome to the .kv file, where you can create graphics without the use of the clunky and cumbersome Init functions in the Python code,
#We can now use the Color and Rectangle functions we imported in the previous file to make a green rectangle

#below is the reference to the Shape widget created in the python code dictated by the <> around the name.

<Shape>:
	canvas:
	
#the function canvas creates the space in which the objects you create can exist in, and you can dictate the size of the canvas as well.
#You do this by applying context and vertex instructions. Context are the colors and textures of the shape, and the Vertex defines the shape and lines of the object
 
		Color:
			rgb:1, 0, .4
			
#Above are context instructions applied to what ever we draw on the canvas if of red, green, and blue values of the color (Values between 0 and 1).

		Rectangle:
		
#size and position (pos) here are vertex instructions at work.		
#In the next app I will go in to more detail about size and position, but pos is given relative to the center of the canvas
#and since we didn't constrain the size of the canvas it will be the size of the app window, so the left bottom corner of the rectangle'
#will be in the center of the window. The size is give in pixels, with width first and height second.

			pos:self.center_x, self.center_y
			size:200, 100
			
#Above are the Vertex instructions that defines the the shape, size, and position of the object.
